This error occurs when you try to access a state variable or prop before it has been fully initialized or updated. This often happens when using asynchronous operations, such as fetching data from an API or making network requests. The component might render before the data is available, resulting in an undefined or null value.  Here's an example:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchData = async () => {
      const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
      const json = await response.json();
      setData(json);
    };

    fetchData();
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{data?.name}</Text>  {/* Error if data is null or undefined */}
    </View>
  );
};
```
